## Introduction
This project builds an autonomous Fire Fighting Robot using Arduino, capable of detecting and extinguishing fires with a flame sensor and a water pump system. It navigates towards the fire source and activates the extinguisher, making it ideal for small-scale fire emergencies in hazardous environments where human intervention is risky.

## Features
Autonomous Fire Detection ‚Äì Uses flame sensors to detect fire sources in real time

Automated Fire Extinguishing ‚Äì Activates a water pump system to suppress fires

Arduino-Based Control ‚Äì Utilizes an Arduino board for efficient and reliable operation

Motorized Mobility ‚Äì Moves towards the fire using motor-driven wheels

Obstacle Avoidance ‚Äì Equipped with sensors to navigate safely around obstacles

Compact & Portable Design ‚Äì Suitable for small-scale fire emergencies in closed or semi-enclosed spaces

Battery Powered ‚Äì Operates independently without the need for a wired power source

Enhanced Safety ‚Äì Reduces human risk in hazardous environments by autonomously responding to fire incidents
